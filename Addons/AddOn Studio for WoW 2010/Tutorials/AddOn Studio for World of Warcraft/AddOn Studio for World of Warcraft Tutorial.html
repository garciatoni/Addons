<h1>1. <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft enables hobbyist, gamers, and seasoned
	developers to develop add-ons
 for World of Warcraft series of games, produced by Blizzard Entertainment. The add-ons
 created with AddOn Studio allow the developer to implement a graphical
 user interface as well as write code using the Lua programming language,
 a lightweight scripting language similar to JavaScript.</p>

<h1>2. <a name="AddonInternals">Internals of a World of Warcraft Add-On</a></h1>
<p>Every World of Warcraft add-on consists of a single Table of Contents
 (TOC) file, as well as Frame XML and Lua files. Frame XML files are ordinary
 XML files that express the user interface of your add-on, whereas Lua
 files contain arbitrary code that runs when your add-on is loaded in World of Warcraft.
 The TOC file contains the list of files that World of Warcraft
 should load when loading your add-on and additional information, such
 as the name of the author and the description of the add-on. For more
 detailed information, please refer to the <a href="#AdditionalDocumentation">Additional
 Documentation</a> section.</p>

<h1>3. <a name="TheAddonStudio">AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft</a></h1>
<p>AddOn Studio for WoW is where you
develop the code and the user interface (UI) to implement the functionality of your add-on.
 In the following illustration, click on the different parts of the development environment
 to read a brief introduction of them.</p>

<ul class="list2">

<li>
	<h2>1. <a name="DesignerDocument">FrameXML Visual Designer</a></h2>

<p>This is the visual representation of the user interface of your add-on
 as it would appear in the game, and also where you place the visual elements
 of your add-on. Select the visual controls from the <a href="#Toolbox">Toolbox</a>.
 To change the properties of a control in the designer, select it and change
 its properties in the <a href="#Properties">Property Grid</a>.</p></li>

<li>
	<h2>2. <a name="Toolbox">Toolbox</a></h2>

<p>Here you find the visual controls you can use to compose the graphical
 interface of your add-on. Using the mouse, select a control from the toolbox
 and drag-and-drop it onto the <a href="#XmlDesigner">Visual Designer</a> surface.</p></li>

<li>
	<h2>3. <a name="Solution">Solution Explorer</a></h2>

<p>Your add-ons are shown here in a list as 'projects', along with all of their associated
 files, and are contained in the currently loaded project-set called a 'solution'. You
 will most often use this pane for opening the files you want to work with. This pane is
 also useful for deploying add-ons you've created to the game to test and run, for changing
 project properties, and for manipulating SCM and publishing your add-on. For more
 information, please refer to the <a href="#CreatingAddon">Creating a World of Warcraft AddOn</a>
 and <a href="#DeployingAddon">Deploying a World of Warcraft AddOn</a>
 sections.</p></li>

<li>
	<h2>4. <a name="Properties">Property Grid</a></h2>

<p>Here you can change the properties of the control that is currently
 selected in the <a href="#XmlDesigner">FrameXML Designer</a>. You will also use
 it to view the existing event handler functions of the selected control,
 and to create new event handler functions. For more information, please
 refer to the <a href="#CreatingAddon">Creating a World of Warcraft AddOn</a>
 section.</p></li>

<li>
	<h2>5. <a name="CodeEditor">Code Editor</a></h2>

<p>The code editor is used to edit Lua, XML, and other add-on text files
 to actually implement the add-on's functionality and logic.
 For Lua language reference resources, please refer to the <a
 href="#AdditionalDocumentation">Additional Documentation</a> section.</p>

<p>This code editor supports IntelliSense, which is a form of automated
 auto-completion used in Microsoft Visual Studio that makes programming
 language references easy to access while coding. You do not need to leave
 the Code Editor pane to search on language elements (members, parameters,
 operators, brace matching, etc.). You can find the information you need,
 insert language elements into your code, and have IntelliSense complete
 the typing for you.</p></li>

<li>
	<h2>6. <a name="MenusToolbars">Menus and Toolbars</a></h2>

<p>Many of the  menus and toolbars in AddOn Studio for WoW are especially suited for
 software development in general, with many others specifically designed for WoW
 add-on development. Some of the WoW add-on specific menus and tool bars will be
 explained later on in this tutorial. To get started, the more general <strong>New</strong>,
 <strong>Open</strong> and <strong>Save</strong> menus will be explained
 below, to help provide context before beginning the actual tutorial steps
 in the next section.</p>

<p>Among the more general Windows menus you will find are the familiar Windows'
 <strong>File &gt; New</strong>, <strong>File &gt; Open</strong>, and
 <strong>File &gt; Save</strong> menus. These can be used to create, open, and save the
 necessary files for your WoW add-on projects. In AddOn Studio for WoW these menus
 can also be used to create or open &quot;<strong>Solutions</strong>&quot; and
 the add-on &quot;<strong>Projects</strong>&quot; themselves. Only one
 solution that can be open at a time, but a <strong>Solution</strong> can
 contain many <strong>Projects</strong>. A solution can also have
 <strong>Solution Folders</strong>, which can be used to organize projects
 under the solution. The <strong>File &gt; New</strong> menu can be used to
 create new solution or to create a new project. If a solution is not
 already loaded, creating a new <strong>Project</strong> will automatically
 create a new <strong>Solution</strong> with the same name for you.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>4. <a name="CreatingAddon">Creating a World of Warcraft AddOn</a></h1>

<p>The following instructions walk you through the steps of creating a
 simple yet functional World of Warcraft add-on. After completing these
 steps, go to the next section for instructions on <a href="#DeployingAddon">deploying</a>
 your add-on.</p>

<p class="pi">Follow these steps to create an add-on using
 AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p><strong>Locate</strong> your <strong>AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft</strong>
 install, or find any shortcut or Pinned shortcut you may have created,
 and then <strong>launch</strong> AddOn Studio for WoW by launching the WowAddonStudio.exe file.</p></li>

<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong>, menu select <strong>New</strong>,
 and then <strong>Project</strong> to create a new World of Warcraft AddOn project.</p></li>

<li><p>In the <strong>New Project</strong> window that appears, select
 the &quot;<strong>Basic Warcraft Addon</strong>&quot; template, enter the name of the new
 project, such as &quot;MyFirstAddOn&quot;, and select the location
 where you want to store all the files associated with this project and
 the solution created for it. The new project location is by default a WowAddOnStudio
 folder in your normal user Documents folder.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="new_project_dialog.png" width="612" height="422">
	</p></li>

<li><p>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The new project shows the visual
 designer and the user interface of your add-on, where you can add various
 controls selected from the <a href="#Toolbox">Toolbox</a>. By default,
 a single frame named Frame1 is shown, which you may resize and move using
 the mouse, or change any of its properties using the <a href="#Properties">Property
 Grid</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>By default, Frame1's position is stationary on the gamer's screen, so to make the
 add-on movable, click the
	<img class="illus" src="button-make_frame_movable.png" width="10" height="10"> icon and then click on the <strong>Make frame movable</strong> option.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="make_frame_movable.png" width="479" height="168"></p></li>

<li><p>Using the mouse,
 select the FontString control from the <a href="#Toolbox">Toolbox</a>
 and drag it to Frame1 to create a label.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="click_and_drag_fontstring_to_frame1.jpg" width="603" height="359"></p></li>

<li><p>To change the
 text it displays and its other properties, select the FontString1 object
 and use the <a href="#Properties">Property Grid</a>. For example, change
 the &quot;text&quot; property to show &quot;Hello world!&quot;.<img class="illus" src="changing_text_of_fontstring1.png" width="693" height="285"></p></li>

<li><p>Now let's add
 a button below FontString1. First, using the mouse (or the <a href="#Properties">Property
 Grid</a>), resize Frame1 to allow space for the button.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="resize_frame1.png" width="357" height="167"></p></li>

<li><p>Select the
 Button control from the <a href="#Toolbox">Toolbox</a> and drag it to
 place it anywhere on Frame1. Using the mouse and/or the <a href="#Properties">Property
 Grid</a>, resize it, move it, change its background and foreground colors,
 change its label, or any other properties, as you like.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="click_and_drag_button_to_frame1.jpg" width="866" height="433"></p></li>

<li><p>Now that the
 user interface of this simple add-on is ready, let's add some code to
 the project. Double-click on an empty area of Frame1 to create the OnLoad
 event handler function for this frame. The <a href="#CodeEditor">Code
 Editor</a> appears where the Frame.lua source code file is loaded and
 is ready to use for adding code for this add-on.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="code_pane-default_code_for_frame1_onload.png" width=693 height=277></p></li>

<li><p>In the body
 of this function, enter the following line of code, which will register
 for the <code>PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED</code>
 event that we are interested in. <span class="code"><br>
 this.RegisterEvent(&quot;PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED&quot;);</span></p></li>

<li><p>To handle the <code>PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED</code>
 event, you will need to define a handler function for the OnEvent event.
 To do this, return to the visual designer by clicking on the <strong>Frame.xml [Design]</strong>
 tab and select the Frame1 object using the mouse.<br>
 <img class="illus" src="code_pane-click_tab_to_return_to_design_view.png" width=693 height=277 border="0"></p></li>

<li><p>In the <strong>Property Grid</strong>, now click the <strong>Events</strong> category button.
 <br/><img class="illusb" src="frame_properties-events_category.png" width="326" height="104"><br/>
 Under the <strong>Events</strong> category,
 you can now see which events have handler functions defined.<br/>
<img class="illusb" src="frame_properties-events_create_existing.png" width="263" height="54"><br/>
 Here you can also create a new event handler function. To
 write some code to handle the <code>PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED</code>
 event, that we registered for in an earlier step, create a new handler function for the
 <code>OnEvent</code> event by selecting the event drop-down<br/>
<img class="illusb" src="frame_properties-events_create_drop.png" width="307" height="37"><br/>
 and clicking on the
<strong>Create</strong> button in the drop-down list.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="frame_properties-events_create_action.png"
	width="293" height="277">
	</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="#CodeEditor">Code
 Editor</a> pane now reappears, showing the new <code>OnEvent</code> handler function where you can enter the code that will be executed
 when an event is triggered.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="code_pane-default_code_for_frame1_onevent.png" width="693" height="277"></p></li>

<li><p>In the body
 of the <code>Frame1_OnEvent</code>
 function, enter the following code, which will change the text property
 of the FontString1 control to a message that includes the name of the
 current target in World of Warcraft whenever the player changes its target:
 <br>
 <code>
	if (event == "PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED") then<br>
		FontString1:SetText("Hello " .. UnitName("target") .. "!")<br>
	end</code></p></li>

<li><p>Now, for the Button1 control (i.e. the <strong>Close</strong>
 button), let's create an event handler function that hides this add-on. Return to the
 game environment by clicking on the <strong>Frame.xml [Design]</strong> tab and select
 the Button1 control using the mouse. In the <a href="#Properties">Property Grid</a>,
 under the <strong>Events</strong> category, select the OnClick event, and in the
 drop-down list click on the <strong>Create</strong> button. You can also create this
 event by double-clicking on the button in the visual designer.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="properties_pane_button-create_onclick_action.png"
		width="245" height="314">
	</p></li>

<li><p>The <a href="#CodeEditor">Code
 Editor</a> appears where, in the body of the <code>Button1_OnClick</code>
 function, enter the following code, which will hide the add-on (i.e. the
 Frame1 frame) whenever the <strong>Close</strong> button is clicked:<br>
 <code>Frame1:Hide();</code><span><br>
	<br>
	<img class="illus" src="code_pane-tutorial_code_for_button1_onclick.png" width="693" height="343"></span></p></li>

<li><p>This add-on is now ready to perform some simple functionality
 in World of Warcraft, but before deploying it, let's change the project's properties to something
 meaningful. In the <a href="#Solution">Solution Explorer</a>, right-click on the name of
 the project (i.e. <strong>MyFirstAddOn</strong><span>) and then click on the
 </span><strong>Properties</strong><span> item in the context menu that appears.</span><br>
	<img class="illus" src="solution_explorer_pane-properties_item_in_context_menu.png" width="269" height="462"></p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>General</strong>
 properties pane appears, where you should enter the details of this add-on. The details you
 enter here are used to generate the table of contents file (A.K.A. the TOC file) so you do not
 need to modify it directly. Of course, you only need to provide personal details if want to.<br>
	<img class="illus" src="project_properties_pane.png" width="772" height="261"></p></li>

<li><p>Save the project and all its files by clicking the
<img class="illus" src="button-save_all.png" width="14" height="14">
 icon on the main toolbar.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1>5. <a name="DeployingAddon"></a>Deploying a World of Warcraft AddOn</h1>

<p>To deploy an add-on using AddOn Studio for WoW, open the add-on's solution in Visual Studio,
if it is not already open. (If you are continuing from the last tutorial above, your
solution will already be open.)</p>

<p class="pi">Follow these steps to deploy an add-on using
 AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p>In the <a href="#Solution">Solution Explorer</a>, right-click on
 the project you want to deploy (in this case <strong>MyFirstAddOn</strong>), and then click
 on the <strong>Build</strong> item in the context-menu that appears.
 <br/><img class="illusb" src="solution_explorer_pane-project_context_build.png" width="230" height="140"></p>

<p>AddOn Studio for WoW will then go ahead and <strong>build</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong>
 your add-on, coping the .toc  file (table of contents) and all of the other necessary files and
 folders to the "Interface\AddOns" directory of your World of Warcraft installation. This is where add-ons
 normally live inside the WoW installation.</p>

<li><p>The output pane will show the build and deployment progress as
 it runs, which should go very quickly.
<br/><img class="illusb" src="output_pane-build.png" width="615" height="136"></p>

<p>At this point your add-on is installed and up to date in WoW, and is available like any
 other add-on for running WoW.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="pe">For detailed information on &quot;creating an add-on&quot;, please refer to
the <a href="#CreatingAddon">Creating a World of Warcraft AddOn</a> section.</p>

<p class="pi">Other helpful deployment options and tips:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p>You can use <strong>Clean</strong> to also un-deploy, or
 remove, an add-on from WoW.
<br/><img class="illusb" src="solution_explorer_pane-project_context_clean.png" width="204" height="91">

<p>AddOn Studio for WoW will then remove your add-on from WoW,
 including all of it's  files and folders.<br/>
<img class="illusb" src="output_pane-clean.png" width="585" height="77"></p>

<p>You will also need to restart WoW to see it removed form
 the <strong>AddOn List</strong> on the log in screen.</p></li>

</ol>

<h1>6. <a name="TestingAddon"></a>Testing a World of Warcraft AddOn</h1>

<p>To test an add-on, you must first <a href="#DeployingAddon">deploy</a> it using AddOn
 Studio, as explained in the previous section. There are two things we can check: one is
 to see if WoW recognizes our add-on and the second is to check our functionality in the
 WoW game UI.</p>

<p class="pi">To test the installation of the add-on created in this tutorial:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p>Launch World of Warcraft and log on.</p></li>

<li><p>After log on, access the <strong>AddOn List</strong> of available
 add-ons using the <strong>AddOns</strong> button in the lower left corner.</p></li>

<li><p>Now make sure the new add-on is enabled. Normally,
 a new add-on will already be enabled after <strong>build</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong>
 in AddOn Studio. You can enable or disable your add-on by changing the check-box next to it.
 Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Enable All</strong> button to enable all add-ons,
 including yours.<br/>
<img class="illus" src="wow_addon_list-myfirstaddon.jpg" width="707" height="318"></p></li>

<li><p>Next enter the world, by clicking <strong>Okay</strong>, which will close the <strong>AddOn List</strong>, then click <strong>Enter World</strong> which will start the regular game UI. The add-on should now automatically
 show in the game's interface.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="pi">To test add-on features  in the game UI created in this tutorial:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p>Click on a new
			<strong>target</strong>. The add-on should display the message &quot;Hello &lt;name of
 target&gt;!&quot;</p></li>

<li><p>Click the <strong>Close</strong> button. The add-on should disappear
 from the game interface.
 <br/><img class="illus" src="wow_world-myfirstaddon.jpg"
		width="490" height="364"></p></li>

</ol>

<h1>7. <a name="CreatingAce2Addon"></a>Creating an Ace2 World of Warcraft AddOn</h1>

<p>The following instructions walk you through the steps of creating a
 simple yet functional World of Warcraft add-on based on the popular
 <a href="http://fallenworlds.org/addonstudio/wow/wowace_ace">Ace2 framework</a>.  More tutorials
 can be found
 <a href="http://fallenworlds.org/addonstudio/wow/wowace_acetutorial">here</a>. <em>(note: this
 tutorial is for Ace2 and needs to be updated for Ace3. The links provided actually point to the current tutorials on WowAce, which refer to Ace3.)</em></p>

<p class="pi">Follow these steps to create an add-on using
 AddOn Studio:</p>

<ol class="list1">

<li><p><strong>Locate</strong> your <strong>AddOn Studio for World of Warcraft</strong>
 install, or find any shortcut or Pinned shortcut you may have created, and then
 <strong>launch</strong> AddOn Studio for WoW.</p></li>

<li><p>In the <strong>File</strong>, menu select <strong>New</strong>, and
 then <strong>Project</strong> to create a new Ace2 based World of Warcraft AddOn project.</p></li>

<li><p>In the <strong>New Project</strong> window that appears, select the
 &quot;WowAce Warcraft Add-on&quot; template, enter the name of the new project (e.g. name
 it &quot;HelloAce&quot;), and select the location where you want to store all the files
 associated with this project and the solution created for it.
 <br><img src="ace_1.png" /></p></li>

<li><p>Click <strong>OK</strong>. The new project shows the code editor with the skeleton of
 an Ace2 add-on.</p>
	<p><img src="ace_2.png" /></p></li>

<li>
<p>We can use the OnInitialize method of
the class to initialize our add-on, subscribe to events, etc. The OnEnabled and the OnDisabled
methods are called by the Ace framework when the add-on gets enabled/disabled. This sample add-on will
display the name of the current Zone the player is in, so we need to respond to the zone changing
events in order to update our UI. There are two events we are interested in:
	<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Events/Z">ZONE_CHANGED</a> and
	<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Events/Z">ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA</a>.

<p>Event handling is very straightforward. We need to call the RegisterEvent method to indicate
we want to be notified when the event fires and we need to declare a method in our add-on with the
same name as the event.</p>
<p><img src="ace_events.png" /></p>
<p>Everything else is handled by Ace.</p></li>

<li><p>We need a Frame to display the current
 zone name, so let's add a Frame to our project. Bring up the context menu in the Solution Explorer
 and choose Add/New Item...</p>
	<p><img src="ace_additem.png" /></p>
<p>Select the Frame in the Add New Item dialog box.</p>
<p><img src="ace_newframe.png" /></p></li>

<li><p>Drop two FontString instances to the Frame
 from the Toolbox and arrange them. The first one will display a static text ("Welcome to"), while
 the second one will show the zone name. Change the Name property of the second FontString to
 "$parentLocationLabel". $parent is substituted by WoW and it is always the name of the parent object.
 In our case the real name of the FontString will be MainFrameLocationLabel.</p>
	<p><img src="ace_frame_layout.png" /></p></li>

<li><p>Change to the Code View of the MainFrame.
 (Open MainFrame.lua in the Solution Explorer.) Add the following code to the Lua file.
 This will be a simple helper function which lets us to change the LocationLabel's text from the
 AddOn.</p>
	<p><img src="ace_mainframelua.png" /></p></li>

<li> <p>Deploy the add-on into World of Warcraft then launch the game. You'll
 see a new Frame which always displays your current location:
	<br/><img src="ace_ingame.jpg" /></p></li>
